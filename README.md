Collaborative File Access Management System

Imports: The code starts with importing necessary C++ standard libraries.

Class Definition - node: This class defines a node with attributes key (priority), id (user ID), and oper (operation type). It includes constructors, destructor, and overloaded operators for assignment and output.

Array Manipulation Functions:

extend: Increases the size of an array by copying elements from the original array.
decEnd and dec: Decrease array size by copying elements while excluding the last element.
Class Definition - Queue: Implements a priority queue using an array. Includes methods for inserting, sorting, heapifying, extracting maximum, finding minimum, and more.

Function - main(): The main function presents a menu-based interface to interact with the data structure. It provides options to load data from a file, insert files/users into the hash table, delete files, request access, release files, print the hash table, and exit the program.

Class Definition - hashtable: Implements a hash table using a linked list of NodeL objects. It manages file access permissions for users and provides methods to insert, delete, and manipulate files and access rights.

Function - main(): The main function presents a menu-driven user interface that interacts with the hash table data structure, allowing users to perform actions such as loading data, inserting files/users, deleting files, requesting access, releasing files, printing the hash table, and exiting.

Please note that the code has a substantial amount of logic related to data structures and algorithms, specifically related to priority queues and hash tables. It appears to manage file access and permissions, allowing users to interact with the system by requesting or releasing access to files. The provided code snippet does not include the generation of a readme file, but you can create one manually to explain the code's purpose, usage, and any other relevant information.
